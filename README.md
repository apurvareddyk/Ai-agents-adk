## 🚀 Project Summaries  

### Academic Research Assistant 🎓  
A multi-agent ADK system designed for academic literature exploration.  
It extracts keywords from public profiles, searches multiple databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, PubMed), and compiles annotated bibliographies with relevance scores, thematic overlaps, and research gap identification.  

### Hotel Agent App 🏨  
An ADK + MCP Toolbox-based travel agent that integrates with SQL databases to plan personalized trips.  
It retrieves and organizes hotel and flight data, enabling itinerary creation and real-time query handling.  

### Personal Assistant 💬  
A conversational assistant that integrates APIs for managing calendar events, reminders, and user notes.  
It demonstrates tool orchestration and natural interaction workflows through ADK’s multi-tool framework.  

### Renovation Agent 🏗️  
A project estimation and proposal-generation agent.  
It helps contractors or clients produce professional renovation reports, contracts, and PDF documents automatically.
